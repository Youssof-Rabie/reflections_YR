# reflections_yr
This is a repository for reflections and notes on concepts and material learned in Udacity's How to use Git and GitHub course. 

This is not a technical repo or a cheat sheet. 
I have created it for pedogogical reasons to learn to use the platform as well as record my thoughts on the materials for future reference.
