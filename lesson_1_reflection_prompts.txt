How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

	shows all the changes that have been made including what aused the bug so one can fix it in the new file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

	Giving the progammer - sort of - a check point of running code before they make their edits. And being able to compare both versions.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Having control over when to update the running version when one is sure that version is well not buggy.
	Which have its advantages to both updating packages and working in a team.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    bacause a project might constitute more than one file and change might occur to arbitrarily many of them in a code change.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows all the commits with information about each: commit ID, the author, time submitted, and a message to make the commit logically 
	distinguishable from other commits.
	git diff shows the changes made from the first to the second id's provided of the commits. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    having an earlier ( commit / source code image ) working properly while the new one does not permenantly overwrite the old version it is.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    maintaining and improving my own projects and having th eflexibity to make improvements and tryign new ideas on the code without being afraid to 
	crash the project, working on projects with others, getting code samples to facilitate devoloping process, collaborating and adding to source code 
	in open-source cummunity-driven projects, obtaining source code for running software on my device to review and explore, and to install packages
	on my device.
